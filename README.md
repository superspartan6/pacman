# Pacman by Caleb Zierenberg

A Python-based Pacman game created with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/). This project is a remake of the classic game, with improvements to the code structure and planned future updates.

## Overview

This project implements a Pacman game where you control Pacman to eat stars while avoiding ghosts. The game features:
- A grid-based map with walls, stars, and tunnels.
- Four ghosts with different targeting strategies.
- Basic game logic for movement, collision, and scoring.

## Features

- **Grid-based Movement:** Move in a discrete grid system that maps your interactions.
- **Ghost AI:** Unique behaviors for each ghost (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde) that target Pacman based on their corresponding algorithms.
- **Scoring System:** Pacman accumulates points by eating stars.
- **Game Over and Victory Conditions:** A message is displayed when you win (all stars eaten) or lose (contact with a ghost).

  Integrate background music and sound effects for actions like eating stars, ghost encounters, and game over sequences.

- **Enhanced Collision Detection:**  
  Refine collision detection for smoother gameplay and more responsive interactions.

- **Additional Levels:**  
  Expand the game with new levels or maps featuring varying difficulty and more complex layouts.

- **Multiplayer Options:**  
  Explore the possibility of adding local or online multiplayer modes for competitive or cooperative play.
